#### BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING

Understanding telecom customer churn is crucial for businesses in the telecommunications industry, as it directly impacts revenue, customer retention, and overall profitability. Customer churn can be voluntary because of dissatisfaction in the services by the service provider and it can also be involuntary because of service disruption or payment issues. Understanding customer churn rates can have financial implications to the provider. Maintaining current customers is cheaper than that acquiring new ones. Analysing churn rates can give an advantage over competitors. This project aims to predict whether a customer will churn or not depending on the several factors on the datasets.
